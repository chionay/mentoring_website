    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>PeerMentor Hub is a student-to-student mentoring and tutoring platform designed to connect students across foundation and bachelor's degree levels.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to help level 4 students by matching them with experienced level 5 and above students who can offer academic guidance and support. The platform offers both free and paid tutoring opportunities, allowing mentors to either contribute voluntarily and enhance their CVs or earn income while studying—creating a win-win situation for all.</p>
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Profiles of mentors with detailed unit history and hourly rates (ranging from free to £50).</li>
      <li>Direct contact information to connect with your chosen mentor.</li>
      <li>A space to build a supportive and collaborative student community.</li>
      <li>Facilitation of one-on-one tutoring focused on understanding course concepts more deeply.</li>
      <li>Transparent system that acts as a middleman to ensure quality and safety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether you’re seeking academic help or offering it, PeerMentor Hub is your go-to place for connection, growth, and opportunity.</p>
