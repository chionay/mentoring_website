Peer Mentor Hub

Peer Mentor Hub is a responsive tutoring/mentoring website built for university students from various study pathways. It connects foundation-level students with more experienced peers who can support their academic journey either voluntarily or for a small fee. This creates free and affordable support, income and a community.

This project provides a digital platform for peer-to-peer academic support:

Mentees - to find experienced mentors.
Mentors - to offer tutoring services, either for free or paid.
Minimalist navigation between Home, About, and Sign-Up sections.
Responsive layout and accessibility across devices.
